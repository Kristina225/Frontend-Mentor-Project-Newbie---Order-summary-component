## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

In this challenge I learned the basics of how to work with media queries and how to add multiple backgrounds on a page (e.g. a background image and a background color). I also learned that the flow of the text-decoration underline in anchor elements is interrupted in letters with descenders (p, g...). I solved this by removing the underline and adding a bottom border.

### Continued development

I need to learn more about background images before starting my next project.

### Useful resources

- [Stack Overflow Post - Interrupted text-decoration underline](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49760273/text-decoration-underline-for-dom-element-doesnt-underline-for-all-letters-in-a) - This helped me solve the problem of letters with descenders interrupting the underline in anchor elements.
